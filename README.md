# buffer-packer

:warning: This module uses NodeÂ´s Buffer! Maybe is not a good ideia to use it in browser environment.

`buffer-packer` can pack and unpack a buffer in a very flexible way.

## get started

```coffee

Packer = require 'buffer-packer'

packer = new Packer 'id:u8b, func:u8b, addr:u16b'

frame = packer.pack {id: 1, func: 2, addr: 0x1234}

console.log frame
# outputs: <Buffer 01 02 12 34> 

console.log packer.unpack frame
# outputs: {id: 1, func: 2, addr: 0x1234}

```

## install and usage

```bash
npm i buffer-packer

#or

yarn add buffer-packer
```

then, in yout code:

```js
const Packer = require('buffer-packer');

let packer = new Packer( 'id: u16b', {} );

let frame = packer.pack( {id: 12} );
```

## packing

When you instantiate the Packer object you must supply a formater string which is a sequence of tags separated by `,`. Each tag is constructed as an almost mandatory `variable` name, a `:` separator and an always mandatory `format` specifier.

Apart the format string, you should pass to the class constructor an object with functions in case you are using any `tap` tag in your formater.

### integers

You can use use a tag like `variable:u16l[2]` to include 4 bytes, being 2 unsigned 16 bits values in little endian order from `variable[0]` and `variable[1]`. Also you can use `:s16b=34` to include the value `34` as a big endian signed 16 bits.

Tags starts with a variable name, a `:` as separator and follows format that must start with `s` or `u` to denote signed and unsigned values, then one of `8`, `16`, `32` or `64` to set its size, and `l` or `b` to set as little or big endian order. Optionally you can define it as an array with fixed or dynamic size with `[2]` and `[myLength]` respectively, **or** you can set a default value with `=123`

When you set a default value the variable name (before `:`), is optional. Also, if you have a default value, its value will be mandatory during parsing.

```coffee
packer = new Packer 'a:u8b, b:u32b, b:u32l, c:u8b[2], c:u8b[len], z:s8b=2, :s8b=2, :s8b=-2'
console.log packer.pack {a:5, b: 0x12345678, c:[1,2,3,4], len:3}
# outputs: <Buffer 05 12 34 56 78 78 56 34 12 01 02 01 02 03 02 02 fe>
```

### float

Float point number format should start with a `f`, can have `32` or `64` as size, and `l` or `b` to set its endianess order.

```coffee
packer = new Packer 'a:f32b, b:f64l'
console.log packer.pack {a:1.2, b:-0.88}
# outputs: <Buffer 3f 99 99 9a 29 5c 8f c2 f5 28 ec bf>
```

### data

This tag can be used for 8 bits data arrays like: js arrays, Buffer or strings.

Format is `data` and a fixed or dynamic data size as in `[2]` or `[leng]`.

```coffee
packer = new Packer 'a:data[3], b:data[3], a:data[len]'
console.log packer.pack {a:'abcdef', b: [1,2], len: 2}
# outputs: <Buffer 61 62 63 01 02 00 61 62>
```

### padding

The tag `:pad[3]` will append 3 bytes of padding zeroes in your data. When a variable name is supplied it should be a 8 bits values to be used as padding. You also can set a default value to be used as padding with `:pad[3]=255` which will append byte `0xff` 3 times to your pack. As in previous cases the size can be fixed or dynamic.

```coffee
packer = new Packer 'a:u8b, :pad[3], p:pad[2], :pad[padlen]=5, b:u8b'
console.log packer.pack {a: 1, b: 2, p:255, padlen: 4}
# outputs: <Buffer 01 00 00 00 ff ff 05 05 05 05 02>
```

### tap

When you use the tag `variable:tap[func]` this will invoke a function called `func` with current buffer and data as parameter, and will append returned value as property `variable` in your data object. After that you can use this value to insert in your pack.

```coffee
calcCRC = (buffer, data) ->
    console.log buffer, data
    # outputs: <Buffer 01 02> {id: 1, func: 2}
    acc = 0
    acc += v for v in buffer
    return acc

packer = new Packer 'id:u8b, func:u8b, crc:tap[calcCRC], crc:u16b', {calcCRC}
console.log packer.pack {id: 1, func: 2}
# outputs: <Buffer 01 02 00 03>
```

## examples

```coffee
Packer = require 'buffer-packer'

data = {a:1, b:0x1234, c:[1,2,3,4,5], len:3}

packer = new Packer 'b:u16l, c:u16b[2]'
console.log packer.pack data
# outputs: <Buffer 34 12 00 01 00 02>

packer = new Packer 'len:u8b, c:u16l[len]'
console.log packer.pack data
# outputs: <Buffer 03 01 00 02 00 03 00>

packer = new Packer 'c:u16b[2], crc:tap[calcCRC], crc:u32b', {calcCRC: (buf) => return 0x12345678}
console.log packer.pack data
# outputs: <Buffer 00 01 00 02 12 34 56 78>
```
